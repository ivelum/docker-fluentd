# Docker-Fluentd: the Container to Log Other Containers' Logs

Hosted on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ivelum/docker-fluentd)

This container is extremely [ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ecs/)-friendly, although it may be used for other environments.

## Supported Environment Variables
| Environment Variable | Purpose                                                   |
| ------------------------- |:---------------------------------------------------------:|
| DEBUG                     | Set to true if local development or non EC2 instance host |
| LOG_ENVIRONMENT          | Logging environment name (e.g. QA or Production). This will be a field in the resulting log entries. Defaults to `development` if not set |
| AWS_REGION               | Set AWS region for CloudWatch. Defaults to `us-east-1` if not set|
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | [AWS Access Key](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/managing-aws-access-keys.html) (Optimally, you can  instead use [Instance Profiles](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html) |
|  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | [AWS Secret Access Key](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/managing-aws-access-keys.html) (Optimally, you can instead use [Instance Profiles](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html) |


## What

By running this container with the following command, one can aggregate the logs of Docker containers running on the same host:

```console
docker run -d --restart=always -e "LOG_ENVIRONMENT=qa" -v /var/lib/docker/containers:/var/lib/docker/containers -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro --name=fluentd ivelum/docker-fluentd    
```
The container logs will forwarded to [CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/cloudwatch/), with the `log_group_name` as the Task definition's family, followed by the set `LOG_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable. The `log_stream_name` will be the ECS container's name, followed by the container's ID (this is necessary due to issues with having more than 1 source for a single log_stream, e.g. [the stored sequence parameter](https://github.com/ryotarai/fluent-plugin-cloudwatch-logs/pull/11)).

The outputted entries looks exactly like Docker's JSON formatted logs, except it will contain additional fields depending on which environment you are using for starting up your other Docker containers.

**The following scenarios are supported and evaluated in the order that they appear:**

| Environment               | Results                                                   |
| ------------------------- |:---------------------------------------------------------:|
| ECS                       | Log entries will use the running ECS [Task Definition](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_defintions.html)'s Family and container name for the `container_project` and `container_name` log fields, respectively. In addition, a field `task_definition_version` will be added to the entries as well.|
| Docker Compose            | Log entries will use the running Docker [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)'s Project and Service for the `container_project` and `container_name` log fields, respectively. |
| Default                   | If container does not fall within either of the previous categories, will not add either of the fields. 

*Docker Compose example*
```console
{"log":"2015-10-15T11:44:27Z 54 TID-gomn1ol8g Appworker/Worker/4cab697c-7e67-40ee-a443-b8f52a034183 INFO: completed in: 232.16888 ms\n","stream":"stdout","container_image":"app_web","container_id":"a8c0128c0b47d5a7a5ed702be3c5f57cd62dc73371d5d7743b63a49ac1e09074","container_project":"app","container_service":"worker","time": "2015-10-23T13:00:42Z","ip_address": "10.212.151.112"}
```

## How

`docker-fluentd` uses [Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org) inside to tail log files that are mounted on `/var/lib/docker/containers/<CONTAINER_ID>/<CONTAINER_ID>-json.log`. It uses the [tail input plugin](https://docs.fluentd.org/articles/in_tail) to tail JSON-formatted log files that each Docker container emits.

Then, Fluentd adds the additional fields using the included `record_transformer` plugin, before writing out to local files using the [file output plugin](https://docs.fluentd.org/articles/out_file). It will also using the [Fluentd CloudWatch Plugin](https://github.com/ryotarai/fluent-plugin-cloudwatch-logs) when sending logs to CloudWatch.

In addition, `docker-fluentd` registers any new containers started from the Docker service on the same host, by using [Docker Gen](https://github.com/jwilder/docker-gen). All of which are managed by a `supervisord` process.

Fluentd has [a lot of plugins](https://www.fluentd.org/plugins) and can probably support your data output destination.
